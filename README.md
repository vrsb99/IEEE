With the rise of technology, restaurants are looking for ways to digitize their customer experience. However, many small and medium restaurants are hesitant to invest in a full-scale POS system with mobile order integration and other features. As a result, they often adopt a minimalistic approach by using a 'scan QR code' for a PDF menu. Unfortunately, this hinders the customer experience and makes it less interactive.

To address this issue, Menufy was created to provide an affordable, easy-to-implement, and interactive user experience. The platform offers additional features such as commission-free payment options, including PayNow, PayLah, NETS, or other online payment methods. With Menufy, customers can quickly pay online according to the menu while the restaurant owner can view the total orders that have been placed.

One of the key advantages of Menufy is that it allows restaurants to provide a more engaging and interactive experience for their customers. By using the platform, restaurants can offer a range of features that would be difficult to implement otherwise. For example, customers can easily customize their orders, and the platform can provide real-time updates on the status of their order.

The 'Add to Cart' feature on the Menufy prototype is a simple and effective way for customers to place their orders. Once an order has been placed, the restaurant owner can view the total orders that have been placed, making it easier to manage and process orders. The commission-free payment options also make it easier for customers to pay for their orders, which can lead to increased sales and customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, Menufy offers an affordable and easy-to-implement solution for small and medium restaurants looking to digitize their customer experience. The platform provides an engaging and interactive user experience, along with commission-free payment options, making it an attractive option for restaurant owners and customers alike. By using Menufy, restaurants can improve their customer experience while increasing their sales and revenue.
